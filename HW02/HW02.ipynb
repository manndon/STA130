Interacting with the ChatBot to try and figure things out was for the most part very easy, as it basically caters to your needs and helps you understand specifically what you don't understand. However, sometimes the responses from the ChatBot are very long-winded and excessive, which can make it frustrating to work with.\n",

They are also great at explaining code you don't understand, although they can sometimes be too talkative."

    "Since joining the course, my view on AI-driven assistance tools has become more positive, as I have found these tools to be very useful in the context of learning coding, statistics, and data science. These tools have saved me a lot of time when it comes to quickly understanding a concept, as well as solving problems that would have otherwise given me a headache. However, one thing I do dislike about the use of AI in this course is its heavy dependence on it (e.g. obligation to show ChatBot logs and summaries). This has sometimes made me feel like I was purely using the AI to satisfy the rubric of the homework, and not for my own personal understanding of the subject material. All in all, I think ChatBots and AI tools have had, and will continue to have a positive impact on learning, especially in subjects such as coding, statistics, and data science."
