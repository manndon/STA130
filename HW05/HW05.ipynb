    "### Summary of Conversation on Hypothesis Testing and p-value Calculation\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Understanding p-values**:\n",
    "   - A p-value quantifies the probability of obtaining a statistic at least as extreme as the observed statistic under the null hypothesis. A low p-value suggests that the null hypothesis is implausible given the observed data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Simulation Approach**:\n",
    "   - We discussed a simulation-based approach to calculate p-values, particularly using a code snippet that generates statistics under the null hypothesis (H0) to determine the p-value for a two-tailed hypothesis test.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Adjusting Code for One-Tailed Test**:\n",
    "   - You provided a code example related to the Vaccine Data Analysis Assignment and asked how to modify it for a one-tailed hypothesis test.\n",
    "   - Key changes included:\n",
    "     - Changing the comparison to only consider whether simulated statistics are greater than the observed statistic.\n",
    "     - This adjustment alters the interpretation, focusing on one direction of the effect (e.g., improvement).\n",
    "     - A one-tailed test generally expects a smaller p-value compared to a two-tailed test when testing the same hypothesis, as it only assesses one tail of the distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Error Encountered**:\n",
    "   - You encountered a `NameError` indicating that `simulated_statistics` was not defined. We identified that this variable was not properly set in the one-tailed test code, which can be resolved by ensuring that it is assigned correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Conclusion**:\n",
    "   - We summarized that using one-tailed tests is appropriate when there is a clear expectation of the direction of the effect, while two-tailed tests are used when the direction is uncertain.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Overview**\n",
    "\n",
    "A most beloved piece of [statistical lore](https://rss.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1740-9713.2012.00620.x) about the (most famous) statistician Ronald Fisher involves cups of tea with milk. Fisher and his friend and colleague, Dr. Muriel Bristol, worked at Cambridge in the 1920s and regularly had tea together. During one of their afternoon tea times, Bristol refused a cup of tea from Fisher because he put milk in first BEFORE pouring in the tea. Bristol said she could taste the difference, and much preferred the taste of tea when the milk was poured in afterward the tea. Fisher didn't think that there could be a difference and proposed a hypothesis test to examine the situation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fisher made 8 cups of tea, 4 with milk added in first and 4 with tea added in first, and gave them to Dr. Bristol without her seeing how they were made and she would say if she thought the tea or the milk was poured first. As it turned out, Bristol correctly identified if the tea or milk was poured first for all 8 of the cups. Fisher, being a skeptical statistician wanted to test if this could be happening by chance with Bristol just randomly guessing (or whether there was evidence against an assumption of Bristol just randomly guessing), and subsequently designed a statistical hypothesis test to do so.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you run an experiment like this with students in STA130. You get a random sample of 80 STA130 students to each taste one cup of tea and tell you whether they think the milk or tea was poured first. **Suppose 49 students are able to correctly state which was poured first.** Provide a statistical analysis of this experiment as guided through the following set of questions.\n",

    "- The analysis here could be approached from the perspective of formal hypothesis testing.\n",
    "    - which would likely involve the simulation of a sampling distribution under $H_0$ in order to estimate p-value with respect to the null hypothesis based on the observed test statistic (how?), concluding with the assement of $H_0$ based on an interpretation of the meaning of the p-value relative to $H_0$\n",

    "### Ethical Professionalism Considerations\n",
    "    \n",
    "Using p-values and hypothesis testing appropriately is an important ethical and professional responsibility of anyone doing data analysis. Actually, there is quite the quiet Contra-Versy (or is it Con-TROV-ersy?) around p-values. First, on a general level, it seems quite clear that p-values and hypothesis testing methodologies MUST play some ongoing contributing role in the so-called \"replication crisis\" rampantly afflicting mordern science; namely, \"significant findings\" made in scientific studies are not able to be reproduced by future studies at an alarming rate; and, this whole paradigm of \"significant findings\" is based on p-values and hypothesis testing... so, something's going on with this methodology in some way...\n",
    "    \n",
    "More specifically however, p-values are themselves quite problematic. To see this, just briefly consider the following article titles...\n",
    "\n",
    "- [Why are p-values controversial?](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00031305.2016.1277161) \n",
    "- [What a nerdy debate about p-values shows about science and how to fix it](https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2017/7/31/16021654/p-values-statistical-significance-redefine-0005)\n",
    "- [The reign of the p-value is over: what alternative analyses could we employ to fill the power vacuum?](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsbl.2019.0174)\n",
    "- [Scientists rise up against statistical significance](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-00857-9)\n",
    "- [Statistics experts urge scientists to rethink the p-value](https://www.spectrumnews.org/news/statistics-experts-urge-scientists-rethink-p-value)\n",
    "\n",
    "While the issues here are relatively advanced and subtle (as introduced [here](https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~berger/p-values.html), presented [here](https://www.jarad.me/courses/stat587Eng/slides/Inference/I06-Pvalues/why_pvalues_dont_mean_what_you_think_they_mean.pdf), and demonstrated using simulation [here](https://jaradniemi.shinyapps.io/pvalue/)), the problem essentially comes down to the fact that most scientists (or just people) don't know how to really interpret the numeric value of a p-value. There are therefore two current proposed solutions to address this challenge.\n",
    "    \n",
    "1. Just interpreting p-values using the follwing table (which really isn't that hard, so it's surprising that this solution isn't more broadly adopted...)\n",
    "    \n",
    "|p-value|Evidence|\n",
    "|-|-|\n",
    "|$$p > 0.1$$|No evidence against the null hypothesis|\n",
    "|$$0.1 \\ge p > 0.05$$|Weak evidence against the null hypothesis|\n",
    "|$$0.05 \\ge p > 0.01$$|Moderate evidence against the null hypothesis|\n",
    "|$$0.01 \\ge p > 0.001$$|Strong evidence against the null hypothesis|\n",
    "|$$0.001 \\ge p$$|Very strong evidence against the null hypothesis|\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Only do **hypothesis testing** on the basis of confidence intervals, not **p-values** (which might be the best solution wherever doing so is a realistic, convenient  possibility...)\n",
    "\n",
    "With this quite broad introductory context in mind, what does your favorite ChatBot thinks about the following statements? \n",
    "    \n",
    "1. Hypothesis testing is not a \"mathematical proof\"<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. We do not prove $H_0$ false, we instead give evidence against the $H_0$: \"We reject the null hypothesis with a p-value of XYZ, meaning we have ABC evidence against the null hypothesis\"\n",
    "    2. We do not prove $H_0$ is true, we instead do not have evidence to reject $H_0$: \"We fail to reject the null hypothesis with a p-value of XYZ\"<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Implying that a \"non-significant result\" means there is \"no effect\" misleads an audience because this may in actual fact simply indicate that there was insufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis. So this therefore overlooks the possibility of sample size limitations, or Type II errors (which means a test incorrectly concludes that there is no effect or difference when, in fact, there is one). \n",
    "    \n",
    "> Similarly, analagously, a \"significant result\" used to reject the null hypothsis could alternatively be a Type I error (which means a test actually incorrectly rejected a null hypothesis when it was actually true)... we're only providing a measure of evidence against the null hypothesis... but the evidence could still incorrectly suggest the wrong conclusion... it really depends on how strong the evidence is...\n",
    ">\n",
    "> - all of which is why just interpreting p-values using the table above is a good idea...\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The p-values used for hypothesis testing are contructed upone the assumptions of the null hypotheses they correspond to; but, null hypotheses are actually often presented in simple forms that routinely hide a lot of information that is implicitly used to construct the p-values. For example, distributional assumptions about the population, estimated \"plug-in\" values that can used to simplify the problem calculations, and the reliance upon \"random sampling\", etc...<br><br>\n",
    "           \n",
    "4. Drawing overly broad conclusions, or making recommendations based on findings that reject the null hypothesis in a specific context is fraught with the problematic risks of overgeneralization errors. Further exacerbating this issue, null hypotheses are typically so called \"point null hypotheses\" which is meant to emphasize that they are mathematically increadibly sharply specific; whereas, alternative hypotheses are usually very unspecific. An alternative hypothesis that \"the null hypothesis is false\" doesn't say much... we should wonder, \"how, specfically, is the null false?\"\n",
    "    \n",
    "As an example really giving a demonstrating this, consider rejecting a null hypothesis that there is no correlation between rain and pizza's delivered. Such a decision doesn't specify what the actual hypothetical correlation might be. In fact, it doesn't even indicate if there are more or less pizzas delivered when it rains... \n",
    "\n",
    "> which, actually, shows very clearly why statistical inference using hypothesis testing is inferior to statistical inference based on confidence intervals...\n",
    "> \n",
    "> - a confidence interval provides a range of plausible values of what the parameter in question might be; whereas, ...\n",
    "> - trying to more clearly address what the plausible values of the parameter in question might be on the basis of hypothesis testing would require conducting further experiements to continously reject increasingly detailed hypothesies to narrow down what the alternative hypothesis might actually include... which would indeed be an utterly vapid misuse of the intended purpose of hypothesis testing entrprise... \n",
